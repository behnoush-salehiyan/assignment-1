            The origin of Termeh weaving in Iran dates back to the early Safavid
            period, although some believe that its birthplace is Central Asia
            and the Kashmir Highlands. Others believe that Termeh weaving began
            in Iran and then spread to Kashmir. What can be said about this very
            delicate fabric is that the taste, creativity, and innovation of the
            Iranians in the finesse of its weave, quality, and imaginative
            designs are unparalleled in the world. This art reached its peak of
            prosperity and perfection during the reign of Shah Abbas Safavi,
            gaining worldwide fame and becoming one of Iran's exported productS

            Copper was one of the most widely used metals in history, especially
            in Asia, Europe, Mesopotamia,and Egypt. The first copper artifacts
            and vessels made from it were discovered in Mesopotamia.Thousands of
            years before Christ, copper was used to make tools and weapons such
            as spears,arrows, pins, axes, water channels, sewage systems, and
            more. In later years, copper was also used in art, leading to the
            creation of copper vessels, handicrafts, and wood carving

            Minakari is an art with a history of about five thousand years, used
            to beautify jewelry and various vessels. This art is a combination
            of fire and clay, blended with painting, creating beautiful designs.
            According to some experts, and through comparing Byzantine minakari
            with Iranian works, this art originated in Iran and then spread to
            other countries. However, ancient artifacts have been found in
            Europe with a much longer history. For example, six gold rings
            dating back to the 13th century BC were discovered in Cyprus, which
            are examples of enameled jewelry. Also, the famous statue of Zeus
            found in Greece dates back to the 5th century BC. Furthermore,
            regarding the glassy enamel minakari on metal, excavations in
            Nahavand have uncovered a pair of gold earrings, with the style of
            goldsmithing dating back to the 7th to 8th centuries BC
